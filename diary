I have an efficient algorithm for finding nearest post code sector but could probably improve data structure.
Nonetheless I get 10,000 tests against 12000 sectors in 4 seconds
23 April 2018
Added timer so we can see how efficient it is
Started using subset of data (1000 points)
Took less than 1 second
21 April 2018
Used postcode sector file successfully on dummy data
Next step: use subset of our results data. Need to import csv and then find way to append postcode sector
21 April 2018
Added code to parse sector csv to dictionary
Next step is to use this to calculate nearest sector

Moved creation of postcodes array out of function so that only runs once (not 2,000,000 times!)

Got test working including postcode info

Created project.
Using np arrays to see if it speeds up calculations
